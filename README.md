# Word Scramble

## Introduction

This is a project that I developed to complete a task from 100 Days of SwiftUI course in HackingWithSwift.com. The main functionality is to play words scramble's game.
The app give you a word and you must create as much words as being possible in order to gain points. There are some rules that you must follow but it's easy to play.
I made some modifications in the project structure to improve it and I also handled some attributes such as @StateObject, @ObservedObject and ViewModel, that allow me improving the code quality without harming the app's reactivity
